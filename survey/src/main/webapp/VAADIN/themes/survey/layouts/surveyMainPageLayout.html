            <p>The following surveys are part of the experiment that make up your participant mark
                for Comm 105. You will receive 3% of your participation mark for completing the
                survey and the experiment session. For your convenience we have split the questions
                into a few parts. You can take them all at once, or you can take breaks in between;
                it's up to you and your schedule.</p>

            <p>These surveys evaluate your perceptions about yourself, your personality, culture,
                and your economic preferences. While you are required to complete the survey to
                receive participation marks, your answers will have no direct effect on your course
                grade. As long as you answer all questions with care, and you attend the experiment session, you will receive credit. </p>

            <p> Important: To save time, some students randomly answers the survey questions. PLEASE
                DO NOT PROVIDE RANDOM ANSWERS. THE SOFTWARE CHECKS FOR RANDOM ANSWER PATTERN. YOU
                WILL RECEIVE NO CREDIT IF YOUR ANSWERS ARE RANDOM.</p>

            <h4>Complete the surveys 12 hours before your session</h4>

            <p>Remember that it is important for the experiment that you complete the surveys
                <strong><em>no later than 12 hours before your experiment lab session</em></strong>.
                For example, if your session is Friday at 11am, you need to complete your surveys
                before Thursday 11pm.</p>

            <p>The answers to the surveys will be aggregated and those interested can receive a
                summary of all responses (no names or ID will be provided, only country averages) so
                you can compare your answers to those of other students and learn from the
                experience.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for your input!</p>
